Try to see if the fixes can contain 100% test coverage

I have 5 years as a Full-stack Java developer. 
The projects required a service which delivered realtime updates of customer data from an insurance policy administration system to an insurance regulator via system to system integrations and Kafka streams.
I implemented this system by developing a microservice with the spring framework which received streaming data via Kafka from an insurance service that a connector which streamed data updates via CDC (change data capture) from the policy administration's enterprise database(AWS RDS MSSQL) to a Debezium connector(Kafka Connect). 
I also incorporated a service which parsed, reformatted and classified the received data according to the specification provided by the regulator. I provided the cleaned data to the collection of API's designed to receive the data.
